# Procedural Planets
This was a project in which I learned to design a system to procedurally generate planets in Unity. This system was created using a tutorial written by Sebastian Lague, which is available on his youtube channel. With this project I learned how to implement noise to create random terrain on a sphere, and how to weigh that noise in order to make acceptable results. I also learned how to create a shader, and the methods needed to add biomes and other terrain to the planets face.
This is an image of a planet created using the system.
